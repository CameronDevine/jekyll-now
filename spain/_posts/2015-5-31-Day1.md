I am in Spain! The flight wasnt too bad. There was a decent selection of movies to watch. Someplace over Hudson bay we saw this amazing sunset.

getting through customs was not an issue at all. I simply handed them my pasport and it was handed back to me about 15 seconds later.

After some problem which I still dont understand completely we ended up in a large apartment with this view from the balcony.

I have been up for more hours than I want to think about. We are going to get some dinner soon then to bed. Tomorrow is the bull fight and whatever else we decide to do.
