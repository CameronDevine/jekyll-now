After getting a new laptop I thought it would be a fun project to turn my old netbook into a tablet. My netbook was an Acer Aspire One without any touchscreen. The first step was to pull the netbook apart and model the pieces.

Modeling the pieces to a reasonable degree of accuracy took a fair amount of time. After this was done I was able to model the new case.

For the top and bottom of the case I decided to get acrylic laser cut with all the holes premade. I still had to countersink all the holes for mounting the 3d printed edge pieces and mounting the motherboard and other electronics.

After 3D printing all of the edge pieces and receiving the laser cut front and back I was ready to put everything together. To make the laptop into a tablet I used a touch screen overlay to turn the screen into a touch screen.

While this project is not 100% complete, it is operational. With so many things to do in life it is hard to put the finishing touches on a project.
