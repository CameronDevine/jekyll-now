After getting a new laptop I thougth it would be fun to turn my old netbook into a tablet. My netbook was a Acer Aspire One without any touchscreen. The first step was to pull the netbook apart and model the pieces.

Modeling the pieces to a reasonable degree af accuracy to a fair amount of time. After this was done I was able to model the new case.

For the top and bottom of the case I decided to get acyrylic laser cut with all the holes premade. I still had to countersink all the holes for mounting the 3d printed edge peices and mounting the motherboard and other electronics.

After 3D printing all of the edge peices and recieving the laser cut front and back I was ready to put everything together. To make the laptop into a tablet I used a touch screen overlay to turn the screen into a touch screen.

While this project is not 100% complete, it is operational. With so many things to do in life it is hard to put the finishing touches on a project.
