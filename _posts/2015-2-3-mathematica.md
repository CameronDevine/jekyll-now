I downloaded a free trial of Mathematica to use on a take home test in my Mechatronics class. After using it for the test I wanted to learn more about it, so I decided to write a simple paper on how to solve differential equtations using Mathematica. Doing this helped me to learn more about Mathematica, including how to use it for typesetting. The paper I wrote is available [here](/files/Power of Mathematica.pdf), and the original notebook file is located [here](/files/Power of Mathematica.nb). After writing this paper I got the full version of Mathematica. As I continue to use if I am constantly reminded how powerful it is.
