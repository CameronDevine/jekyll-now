In my freshman year I took a class on AutoCAD. As a final project we were assigned to design our dream house. Since I am somewhat interested in sustainability I designed a very unique and fairly complex house. The set of plans is available [here](/files/House.pdf), and the original AutoCAD DWG file is available [here](/files/House.dwg). I enjoyed this project becuse I was in charge of all aspects and was able to move at my own pace.
