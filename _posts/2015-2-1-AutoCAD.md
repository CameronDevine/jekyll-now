In my freshman year I took a class on AutoCAD. As a final project we were assigned to design our dream house. I designed a very unique and fairly complex house.

The set of plans I created is available [here](/files/House.pdf), and the original AutoCAD DWG file is located [here](/files/House.dwg). I enjoyed this project because I was in charge of all aspects and was able to move at my own pace.
