Last semester in my Instrumentation class we were offered extra credit if we wrote a response to Alfred North Whitehead's essay "The Aims of Education". This was the Presidential Address he gave to the Mathematical Association of England in 1916. Even though it was written so long ago many of his points on education are still valid today. As I was reading the essay I saw many parallel between his points and my experiances as an engineering major in a liberal arts school. Whitehead's essay can be found [here](/files/Whitehead1916a.pdf), while my response can be found [here](/files/Response to The Aims of Education.pdf). I enjoyed working on this assignment since it encouraged me think critially about my education.
