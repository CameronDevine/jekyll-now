Last semester in my Instrumentation class we were offered extra credit if we wrote a response of Alfred North Whitehead's The Aims of Education. This was the Presidential Address he gave to the Mathematical Association of England in 1916. Even though this was written so long ago many of his points about education are still valid today and need consideration in our education system. As I was reading the I saw many parallels between my experiance in school and the essay. The The original essay can be found [here](/files/Whitehead1916a.pdf), and my response can be found [here](/files/Response to The Aimes of Education.pdf). I enjoyed this assignment since it forced me to think more critially about my education.
