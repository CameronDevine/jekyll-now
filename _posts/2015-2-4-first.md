In my last two years of High School I was on a FIRST Robotics team. In my senior year I was in charge of the CAD design of the robot.

That year the game was shooting frisbees through targets. During the same season my team also decided to construct the robot chassis entirely out of laser cut plywood. To find the best method to make the chassis took several ittereations of a plywood square tube design was tested. The best design turned out to be box joints staggered to space out the stress concentrations. In the end this robot was able to take us all the way to the World Championships in St. Louis.
