In my last two years of High School I was on a FIRST Robotics team. In my senior year I was in charge of the CAD design of the robot. This year the game was shooting frisbees through targets. This year my team also decided to construct the robot chassis out of laser cut plywood. To find the best method to make the chassis took several ittereations of the design. The best design turned out to use box joints and stagger the stress concentrations. In the end this robot was able to take us all the way to the World Championships in St. Louis.
