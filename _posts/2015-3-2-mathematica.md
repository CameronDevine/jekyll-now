title: Power of Mathematica

I downloaded a free trial of Mathematica to use on a take home test in my Mechatronics class. After using it for that test I wanted to learn more about it so I decided to write a simple paper on how to solve differential equtations with Mathematica. The paper is available
[here](/files/Power of Mathematica.pdf)
. The original notebook file is also located
[here](/files/Power of Mathematica.nb)
. While writing this paper I realized how much I enjoy technical writing. The utilitarian format and style is something I appreciate.
