title: Power of Mathematica
---

I wrote this thing on the Power of Mathematica after I got a free trial. This paper deals with the method and theory of solving differential equations with Mathematica. I origninally got the trial of Mathematica to use on a Mechatronics test. After using it on the test I decided I wanted the full version.
