Last semester I took a class focusing on Matlab. For a final project in the class we were asked to make a GUI to solve a simple engineering problem. My group decided to build an app which would calculate the power required for a water pump. To find the denisty of water, a polynomial function was created from a table in a textbook. The final app is located [here](/files/Water Pump Power Calculator.mlappinstall). I enjoyed this project because it was something I had never done before.
