Last semester I took a class focusing on Matlab. For a final project in the class we were asked to make a GUI to solve a simple engineering problem.

My group decided to build an app which would calculate the power required for a water pump. To find the density of water, a polynomial function was created from a table in our textbook. This polynomial is then used to find the density for any water temperature. The final app install file can be found [here](/files/Water Pump Power Calculator.mlappinstall). I enjoyed this project because it was something I had never done before. I also found a certain joy in telling a computer the steps to solve a problem.
