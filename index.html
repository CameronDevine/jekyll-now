Hi, I am Cameron Devine. I currently attend Saint Matin's University in Lacey, WA and study Mechanical Engineering. I hope to recive my bachelors degree in May 2016. Currently I am taking classes in System Dynamics, Machine Design, Autodesk Inventor, and Fluid Dynamics. In the past I have taken and enjoyed classes on Mechanics of Materials, Mechatronics, and Matlab. I have recently become a tutor to share my knowledge in the lower level engineering classes. I decided to become an engineer because I already viewed myself as one. Growing up both my parents were engineers along with my Grandfather. I am actually a fourth generation engineer. In the future I hope to work on diverse projects and therefore continue to learn more about engineering and other fields.</p>
