Welcome to my campaign website. I am running for ASSMU because I would like to make positive change for future engineering and non engineering students.

### About Me

First off I am an engineering student so please excuse any spelling or grammatical errors in this statement. I would love to remove English from the engineering curriculum but the logic I have gained from these engineering classes tells me it is still useful. However the lack of a technical writing class is a problem. In my first year at St. Martinâ€™s I lived on the Norcia Floor. This helped me gain social skills but I am still stereotypically awkward enough to qualify for the Senator of Engineering position. With this awkwardness I still manage to be a peer tutor for engineering classes. This allows me to regularly talk to freshman and sophomore engineering students about their studies.
Please vote for me as I know many of you did for homecoming prince.

### Goals

+ Bring a logical, engineering approach to the ASSMU Senate.
+ Work with faculty and staff to revamp the egineering curriculum such as adding technical writing.
+ Connect the school of engineering with the rest of the campus.
+ Share engineering resources with students of other disciplines.
